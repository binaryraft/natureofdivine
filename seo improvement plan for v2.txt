Answer real search intent questions

End with a soft CTA:

Join discussion

Subscribe for reflections

Read the book for deeper insight

Add internal linking suggestions (blog → book → discussion)

2️⃣ Discussion / Community Page

Rewrite intro text to:

Invite seekers, not debaters

Emphasize shared exploration

Encourage posting experiences, not opinions

Include emotionally resonant prompts like:

“What practice brought you clarity this week?”

“What does the divine mean to you personally?”

3️⃣ Book Purchase Page

Rewrite copy to:

Focus on what the reader will experience and gain

Highlight transformation, clarity, alignment

Clearly state who the book is for (and implicitly who it’s not for)

Use subtle urgency and emotional pull

Optimize for transactional SEO keywords

End with a confident, calm CTA (not aggressive)

4️⃣ Email Signup Sections

Promise value: insights, practices, reflections

📈 CONVERSION & ENGAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

Content should gently move users:
Blog → Discussion → Email → Book Purchase

📦 OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

When rewriting:

Clearly label sections (Blog, Discussion Page, Book Page, Email CTA)

Does this content sound human, grounded, and timeless?

Would Google clearly understand what this site is about?

Would a reader feel compelled to stay, subscribe, and buy?
