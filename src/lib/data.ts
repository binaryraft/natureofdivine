      The air in the Vatican's secret archives was thick with the scent of aging parchment and beeswax. Dr. Aris Thorne ran a gloved finger over the spine of a leather-bound codex, its title long faded into obscurity. He wasn't supposed to be here. His access had been a carefully orchestrated 'accident,' a favor called in from a contact who now likely regretted their acquaintance. But the rumor of the 'Seraphim's Codex' had been too tantalizing to ignore. It was said to contain a dialogue, not between man and God, but between God and... something else. He felt a chill that had nothing to do with the chamber's temperature. The silence was absolute, a heavy blanket that seemed to absorb sound. It was then he saw itâ€”not on a shelf, but resting on a velvet-draped lectern in the center of the room, as if waiting for him. Its cover was unadorned, a deep, starless black that seemed to drink the light. His heart hammered against his ribs. This was it. As his fingers touched the cover, a low, resonant chime echoed through the archive, a sound that was both beautiful and terrifying. An alarm. He hadn't even opened it.

      Rome's labyrinthine streets were a welcome chaos after the sterile silence of the archives. Aris clutched the satchel containing the codex, its weight a constant, unnerving reminder of his transgression. He darted through a throng of tourists near the Trevi Fountain, the cacophony of their chatter and the splash of water a fragile shield. He kept to the shadows, his senses on high alert. A glimpse of a figure in a dark overcoat, unseasonably warm for the Roman evening, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him. Coincidence? He ducked into a narrow alley, the smell of damp stone and fried artichokes filling his nostrils. The footsteps followed, their rhythm too steady, too purposeful to be a random passerby. He was being hunted. The stories weren't just academic legend; the organization, the 'Keepers of the Word,' was real. He broke into a sprint, his polished loafers slipping on the slick cobblestones. The alley twisted, opening into a small, deserted piazza. He was cornered. The figure emerged from the alley's mouth, his face obscured by the brim of a fedora. "Dr. Thorne," a voice like grinding stones echoed in the enclosed space. "You have something that does not belong to you. Something you cannot possibly understand."
